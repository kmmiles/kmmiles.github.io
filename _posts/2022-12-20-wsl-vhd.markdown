WSL stores each distribution, and all files contained in it, within a single VHD disk image.
And there's no decent generic way of decoupling that data.

## Windows Requirements

 - Windows 11 21H2 or higher.
 - WSL installed from the Microsoft Store: <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/a-preview-of-wsl-in-the-microsoft-store-is-now-available/>

## The new `--mount` option in WSL

So, I first learned that Microsoft included a new `--mount` option in the `wsl` utility that opens the door for some pretty neat things: <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl2-mount-disk>. 

My first thought was to add a seperate partition to my drive, and use `wsl --mount` to mount it within WSL.
I quickly ran into a major limitation:

> “it's not possible to use wsl --mount to read a partition on the boot device, because that device can't be detached from Windows.”

Ouch. That means I'd need to dedicate a second *physical* disk to WSL. Well, my laptop doesn't *have* a second physical disk. :(

## Using a virtual hard drive (VHD)

Fortunately WSL has added yet another new option: `wsl --mount --vhd`. That means I could use a VHD disk image instead of a second physical disk to achieve the same thing. But as expected, I ran into more limitations:

  - It requires the `Mount-VHD` tool, which is not included in Home editions.
  - The process requires jumping between GUI's, Powershell, and WSL.

Well, screw that. How about we do all this entirely within WSL?

### Install Linux requirements

Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt install qemu-utils ntfs-3g util-linux`

Redhat/Fedora: `sudo dnf install qemu-img ntfsprogs util-linux`

> If you don't care about ntfs, you can omit the ntfs packages.

### Create the VHD

Use `qemu-img` to create a 10GB VHD called `mydisk.vhdx`.


```bash
qemu-img create -f vhdx /mnt/c/mydisk.vhdx 10G
```

> NOTE: The VHD files **must** be stored on Windows.

### Attach the VHD to WSL

First we need to "attach" aka "bare mount" the VHD. This exposes the device to Linux without actually mounting it:

```bash
wsl.exe --mount --vhd --bare 'C:\mydisk.vhdx'
```

> Pro-tip: When calling Windows programs from WSL, you need only append the command with `.exe`.

Now use `dmesg` to see which device it mapped to:

```
[227979.476940] scsi 0:0:0:4: Direct-Access     Msft     Virtual Disk     1.0  PQ: 0 ANSI: 5
[227979.478324] sd 0:0:0:4: Attached scsi generic sg4 type 0
[227979.478866] sd 0:0:0:4: [sdd] 20971520 512-byte logical blocks: (10.7 GB/10.0 GiB)
[227979.479499] sd 0:0:0:4: [sdd] Write Protect is off
[227979.479898] sd 0:0:0:4: [sdd] Mode Sense: 0f 00 00 00
[227979.480433] sd 0:0:0:4: [sdd] Write cache: enabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA
[227979.483982] sd 0:0:0:4: [sdd] Attached SCSI disk
```

As we can see, the device was attached to `/dev/sdd`.

### Special caveats for NTFS

There are two major caveats for NTFS:

**1) Windows can't read an NTFS filesystem on a VHD unless it's created on a partition.**

The below command will create a partition table and a new NTFS partition on `/dev/sdd`

```bash
printf 'n\np\n1\n\n\nt 1\n7\nw\n' | sudo fdisk /dev/sdd
```

The partition can now be formatted: `sudo mkfs.ntfs /dev/sdd1`

**2) The WSL kernel does not support NTFS (go figure)**

That means `wsl.exe` can only attach (bare mount) the VHD. We have to manually `mount` it using the FUSE userland driver.

```bash
sudo mount /dev/sdd1 /mnt/wsl/mydisk
```

> Because we used `mount`, `wsl.exe --unmount` will only be able to detach the device, therefore you must also
> call `umount /mnt/wsl/mydisk`.

The three steps below (format, detach and mount) can be skipped.

### Format the VHD

Now let's format it with our filesystem of choice. We'll choose `ext4` for this example: 

```bash
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdd
```

> Pro-tip: Run `cat /proc/filesystems` to view the filesystem types supported by the kernel.
> You may need additional tools to utilize them e.g. Btrfs requires `btrfs-progs`.

### Detach the VHD from WSL

At this point we could `mount` it, but we'd rather detach it and use `wsl.exe --mount` instead.
This will be the normal mounting procedure going forward.

```bash
wsl.exe --unmount '\\?\C:\mydisk.vhdx'
```

> Note the single quotes and strange `\\?\` prefix. Long story short, it's required for `--unmount`.
> You could also simply do `wsl.exe --unmount`, which will unmount anything you've mounted with
> `wsl.exe --mount`. Don't worry, it won't unmount your `/` drive.

## Mount the VHD

```bash
wsl.exe --mount --vhd --name "mydisk" 'C:\mydisk.vhdx'
```

The VHD should now be mounted at `/mnt/wsl/mydisk`.
Even better, this mountpoint is exposed to *all* WSL distributions!

> If you omit `--name` the mountpoint will be the VHD path, stripped of delimiters e.g. `/mnt/wsl/Cmydiskvhdx`.

## Change ownership 

At this point, only `root` will have write access to the mountpoint. To give the current user access:
```bash
sudo chown "$(id -un):$(id -gn)" /mnt/wsl/mydisk
```

## Automatically mounting on startup

With a little effort, we can automatically mount the VHD when launching a distribution.

Create the following shell script at `/onboot` e.g. `sudo editor /onboot`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

/mnt/c/WINDOWS/system32/wsl.exe --mount --vhd --name 'mydisk' 'C:\mydisk.vhdx'
```

Give it execute permissions:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /onboot
```

Now `sudo editor /etc/wsl.conf` and add:

```
[boot]
command = /onboot > /onboot.log 2>&1
```

> An external script is used because `command` will choke parsing Windows paths.

Now shutdown WSL with `wsl.exe --shutdown`. Upon relaunching the VHD should automatically be mounted.

> If something goes wrong, check the output stored in `/onboot.log` 

## Compact the VHD aka sparsify aka thin provision

After significant use and/or filling the VHD to capacity and free'ing up space, the actual size on disk
will not be automatically freed. You can reclaim a percentage of this space with the following:

```bash
dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/wsl/mydisk/zeros
rm -f /mnt/wsl/mydisk/zeros
wsl.exe --unmount '\\?\C:\mydisk.vhdx'
qemu-img convert -f vhdx -O vhdx /mnt/c/mydisk.vhdx /mnt/c/mydisk-thin.vhdx
mv /mnt/c/mydisk-thin.vhdx /mnt/c/mydisk.vhdx
```

> This is the equivalent of the `compact` feature of the Windows `diskpart` tool.
